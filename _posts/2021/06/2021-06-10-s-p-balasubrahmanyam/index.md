> A true musician never dies, he just stops performing live.

Music and memories never die.This holds true for S P Balasubrahmanyam who has left a great impact in our lives. I have been listening to SPB's songs since I was a kid. His constant presence in music is such that we can't imagine he is no more . He has mesmerized the entire music world with his euphonious voice. I am confident that he would live on through his music for many more years to come. I have a few personal favourites which I listen to often
