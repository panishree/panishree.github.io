How beautiful a person looks wearing a captivating earrings! I love wearing all kinds of earrings - be it a stud, a jhumka or a hanging.

I am reminded of songs dedicated to praise beauty of a woman wearing magnificent earrings. "Jhumka Gira Re", "Hai Re Hai Tera Jhumka".

I am enchanted with this pretty thing. I am in the process of collecting a huge number. Wish me good luck

:-P
