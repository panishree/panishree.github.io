How delighted we are when we use our mobile phones to keep in touch with our dear and near ones. Does it help in communication? Well, it holds true to an extent since it's a necessity. It serves as a mini computers these days.

My phone Â too is very helpful. But I get irritated with the number of wanted and unwanted calls in a day. It's more like a medium for gossip these days. I put my mobile in silent Mode most of the time to stay calm and undisturbed. There's no use in buying a high end set just to gossip.
