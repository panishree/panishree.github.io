Wow! What a pleasant experience it is to watch Poirot and Inspector Morse. I found a rare combination of perfection, smartness and intelligence in these individuals.

It was worth watching an episode of these two on a Sunday evening rather than a crowded mall or cinema theatre. The stories Â were full of mystery, suspense and thrilling elements. The stories unfold from familiarity to strangeness. I was quite amazed by their keen sense of observation. David Suchet and John Thaw are superb in their roles. I have made up my mind to watch all their episodes.
