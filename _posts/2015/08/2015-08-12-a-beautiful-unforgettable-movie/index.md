I came across one of the most heart melting and haunting masterpiece recently-The Grave of the Fireflies. There are no proper adjectives to describe this movie. It is highly emotional and one of the best movies ever made in Japan. It is the best classic cult.

The movie talks about the life of two young children during the war. The suffering of the siblings when their mother die and when they are unable to get the food is brought alive by the director. The innocence of the children is picturised wonderfully. The fireflies is also one of the characters of the movie.

This movie brought in a strong emotional response from many people. I shed a lot of tears while watching it. It is one of the most remarkable movie in my opinion.
