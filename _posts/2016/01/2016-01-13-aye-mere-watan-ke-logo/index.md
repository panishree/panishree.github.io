Aye mere vatan ke logon, jara aankh me bhar lo paani Jo shahid huye hain unaki, jara yaad karo kurbaani

Wow! What a song! How soulful and meaningful were the lyrics!

We often forget to pay tribute to the lyricists who put life into the song. We get mesmerised by the things in the forefront.

This song was written by Kavi Pradeep as a tribute to the soldiers who died fighting for the country during the Sino Indian war.This masterpiece had brought tears in Jawaharlal Nehru's eyes when Lata Mangeshkar had sung it for the first time.

Ramachandra Narayanji Dwivedi,also known as kavi Pradeep was a famous Indian poet and songwriter. His other songs includeÂ Door Hato Ae Duniya Walo (Move Away O Outsiders),Chal Chal Re Naujawan in film Bandhan (1940) and Aao Bachcho Tumhein Dikhayen and De Dee Hame Azaadi Bina Khadag Bina Dhaal in film Jagriti (1954).

In 1997, he was honoured by India's highest award in Cinema, the Dada Saheb Phalke Award for Lifetime Achievement.
