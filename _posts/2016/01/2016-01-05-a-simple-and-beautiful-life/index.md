Anyone can love a rose,but it takes a lot to love a leaf. It’s ordinary to love the beautiful, but it’s beautiful to love the ordinary".

Wow! What a beautiful quote! Talks about a simple thought but it's quite powerful. Everything is beautiful but not everyone sees it said Confucius. Both the quotes have profound message.

I particularly like this thought a lot. I believe that we tend to forget small things which brings in a lot of happiness. Being simple and ordinary is one the most complicated issue these days. It is very important to understand that the happiest people don’t have the best of everything, they just make the best of everything.

Everything has its value, even the very tiniest thing does. We need to learn to know the value of everything and make use of this knowledge. I recently read this story.

"There was once a Zen Master, who was about to take a bath. His student had prepared the water for him. The water was so cold that the Master told his student to change it for him, "Fetch me warm water!" The student threw the cold water away and fetched warm water for his teacher. When the Master saw his student throw the cold water away, he said to him, "Why do you throw water away unprofitably? Everything has its value, even a drop of water has its value. If you water a flower, it will nurture the flower. And it is not only the flower that profits from this, for the water also feels useful and helpful to the flower and the flower will decorate the earth beautifully."

Life is beautiful in its ordinary terms. Let's not make it complicated.
