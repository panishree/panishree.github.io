"A place for everything, and everything in its place” – Mrs Beeton (The book of household management)

I feel happy and excited to read these words. If we are organised, life becomes happy, simple, productive and interesting. Being organised makes life more functional and less frustrating.

Staying organised is not limited to physical things. It includes keeping things in order, developing habits, managing time, giving up procrastination, writing down things, discarding unwanted things, following routines and to stay focused till the end.

Attitude is important. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, "Most of the shadows of life are caused by standing in our own sunshine." Right attitude is the right choice for living. Developing positive perspective towards everything is the first step.

An organised life is a happy life. Being organised has helped me remain calm, balanced and maintain my life in order. Happiness is not a chance but a choice.
